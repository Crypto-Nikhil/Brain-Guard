**SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT**
**Flask Integration:** Integrated Flask, a Python web framework, into your Brain Tumour Detection project. Flask provides routes for handling user interactions, making it easy to incorporate your machine learning model into a web application.

**User Interface:** Created a user-friendly interface using HTML templates served by Flask. Users can interact with the application through a web browser, uploading MRI images directly to the system.

**Model Deployment:** Deployed your machine learning model (which combines CNN and ResNet50) within the Flask application. Upon receiving an MRI image, the system preprocesses the image and passes it through the model to make predictions.

**Prediction Output:** Displayed the prediction results back to the user on the web page. The system provides information about the type of tumor detected in the uploaded MRI image, achieving a high accuracy rate of 99.3%.

**Flexibility:** Users can update MRI images through the Flask-based web interface, enabling easy interaction and seamless integration of the tumor detection system into clinical workflows or research projects.
